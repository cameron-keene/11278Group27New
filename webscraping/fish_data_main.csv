51,Gulf Sturgeon,Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi,Native,"The Gulf sturgeon, also known as the Gulf of Mexico sturgeon, is one of seven species of sturgeon found in North America.  Sturgeons are prehistoric species that date back to the time of dinosaurs.  Sturgeons are popular in the food industry as a source of caviar.  They have physical features that separate them from other kinds of fish, such as a spiral valve stomach and cartilaginous skeleton (like sharks and rays); however, they have scutes (hard, protective, large individual body plates) instead of shark’s denticles or bony-fish’s scales.  Gulf sturgeon have barbels located on the underside of the snout, no teeth, rubbery lips, and a suctorial mouth for vacuuming food off the bottom.  The sturgeon's coloring typically is dark brown along the upper (dorsal) side shading to a creamy white-colored belly (Wakeford 2001).  Gulf sturgeon are large fish that can exceed a length of eight feet (2.4 meters), a weight of over 300 pounds (137 kilograms), and possess strength to leap nine feet (2.7 meters) into the air.","Sturgeon are anadromous, a term used to describe fish that spend a part of their lives in saltwater, yet travel upstream in freshwater rivers to spawn. Such fish return year after year to the same stream where they were hatched. For Gulf sturgeon, which are found from Florida to Louisiana, this means a move from salt to fresh water between February and April and a move downriver between September and November. They spend the winter in the Gulf of Mexico in sandy-bottom habitats six to 100 feet deep, where their diet consists of marine worms, grass shrimp, crabs and a variety of other bottom-dwelling organisms. They eat very little while in freshwater rivers.","Little is known about the early life stages of the Gulf sturgeon throughout its range.   After the late 1800s, Gulf sturgeon populations declined dramatically, a result of the high demand for their delicious meat and valuable roe, and dam construction, dredging activity and other man-made habitat alterations. The decline prompted state and federal officials to place the sturgeon on the protected species lists in the 1980s and 1990s and to enact a harvesting and possession ban. Today, the free-flowing, spring-fed Suwannee River supports the largest and most robust population of Gulf sturgeon in the state and the wider Gulf of Mexico region. Adults spawn on scoured limestone substrates in the upper reaches of this 200-mile long river. As they swim along, sturgeon occasionally leap out of the water. Every spring and summer, lucky boaters and campers along the Suwannee River witness this spectacle. Power boaters can reduce the risk of injury to themselves and the fish by boating slower during the appropriate time of year. This also increases the chance of seeing the sturgeon and other wildlife along the way.", ,https://myfwc.com/media/14400/gulfsturgeon.png

95,Smalltooth sawfish,Pristis pectinata,Native,"The smalltooth sawfish is a cartilaginous fish that belongs to the Subclass Elasmobranchii, which also includes all sharks and rays.  This dorsally tannish-brown fish can reach a total length of up to 18 feet (5.5 meters) including the saw (Bigelow and Schroeder 1953).  The species’ common and scientific names are derived from its long, flattened, toothed rostrum (nose or beak structure) that extends outward from its flattened head.  The rostrum resembles a saw because it has 24–32 unpaired saw teeth on each side.  Rostral teeth that are lost will not grow back; however, chipped teeth will continue to grow as long as the base is intact (Slaughter and Springer 1968).  The mouth teeth are small and flat like other rays.  The smalltooth sawfish is considered a type of ray, in part because the gill slits are located on the bottom of the body and the pectoral fins are attached to the head.","Juvenile smalltooth sawfish habitats differ from adult habitats.  Juveniles inhabit coastal areas such as estuaries, river mouths, and bays year-round.  They have been recorded from a variety of habitat types including un-vegetated mud and sand bottoms, especially along red mangrove shorelines.  Also, juveniles use creeks and canals that connect to the main stem of rivers as habitat. (Poulakis et al. 2010, 2011).  Potential habitat includes waters under docks, bridges, and piers.  Juveniles typically inhabit salinities between 18 and 30 parts per thousand (PPT) (the ocean is 35), sometimes miles up rivers (Poulakis et al. 2010, 2011; Simpfendorfer et al. 2011).  Adult smalltooth sawfish are typically found in open water habitats, but have been encountered near coral reefs and occur inshore during the spring when females give birth and mating is thought to occur.  Of seven species of sawfish found worldwide, the only species found in Florida waters is the smalltooth sawfish.  Although the historical range of this species extended from the U.S. down to Brazil, all life stages of smalltooth sawfish are found primarily from Charlotte Harbor, Florida to the Florida Keys (Seitz and Poulakis 2002; Poulakis and Seitz 2004, Mote Marine Laboratory Database).","Little is known about what the smalltooth sawfish feeds on.  Their diet is thought to consist of crabs, shrimp, small fish, and other bottom-dwelling organisms (Bigelow and Schroeder 1953).  The saw is used to slash at prey in the water column and to dislodge prey from bottom-dwelling habitats.", ,https://myfwc.com/media/18518/smalltoothsawfish.jpg

This is a gourmet fish in the Asian markets and is often used in Sushi.  It tends to be bony by American standards but is good smoked.",American eels are found in waters with coastal access along the Atlantic seaboard of the US. Eels are primarily riverine but access ponds and lakes.  They orient to structure and flow.,"Spawning is still not well understood but fascinating.  The adults migrate to the ocean during autumn.  During the long trek the fish metamorphose into a ""silver eel"" stage and stop eating.  The fish head to a location near the Sargasso Sea where they spawn en masse and apparently die.  The eggs hatch into leaf-shaped floating leptocephalus larvae that drift with the currents.  When they come within range of a freshwater river, the leptocephalus metamorphoses again into a tiny semi-transparent ""glass eel"".  The glass eel then changes again into a pigmented pencil eel and continues its migration upstream to find a habitat to mature and await it's time to go spawn.  This process of spawning in the ocean and maturing inland is termed catadromy (the fish are catadromous). American eels are opportunistic feeders, which means they eat whatever food is available to them. They are considered carnivorous and eat a variety of food, including fish, frogs, insects and dead organisms.

158,Piranha, ,Nonnative,"Deep laterally compressed bodies are generally silvery or golden in color, with a short adipose fin, jaws with a single row of sharp tricuspid sheering teeth and no molars.  Other characids look somewhat similar but can be distinguished primarily by the dentition.  Pacus (Colossoma spp.), and silver dollars (Metynnis spp.) as well as Myleus spp. and Mylossoma spp. have molar-like teeth used for crushing food.  In telling Piranhas from Metynnis and other silver dollars, the angle of the jaw is a pretty good characteristic for sorting them...forward jutting lower jaw that forms a V at the angle is a piranha, even upper and lower jaw profile that forms a U at the angle of the jaw is not a piranha.",Rivers,Feeding Habits, ,https://myfwc.com/media/26792/pygocentrus_nattereri.jpg
159,Redbreast Sunfish,Lepomis auritus,Native,A very long black ear flap distinguishes this fish from other Florida bream.,"Also known as river bream and redbellies, these are the flowing water cousins of bluegill. Redbellies often can be found in backwater areas with less flow, especially where there are sandy bottoms. Common in rivers of north Florida, but absent from south Florida.","The redbreast's diet is probably the most varied of any of the sunfishes. Principal food organisms are bottom-dwelling insect larvae, snails, clams, shrimp, crayfish, and small fish. Compared to some sunfish, redbreasts grow slowly. Redbreast reach six inches in about two to three years.",State Record:  2.08 lbs.,https://myfwc.com/media/16195/redbreast.jpg
160,Redear Sunfish,Lepomis microlophus,Native,A bright red mark on the back edge of the gill cover is very distinctive.,"Redear prefer hard bottoms, congregating in deeper water than bluegill.","They prefer snails and clams, giving them their common nickname.

161,Sailfin Catfish, ,Nonnative,"All three suckermouth catfishes (family Loricariidae) in Florida have rows of bony plates covering all but their belly area. Sailfin catfish are distinguished by worm-like pattern of dark markings on the head over a dark-golden background; pectoral fins stout with rough surfaces resembling course sandpaper; disc-like, protrusible mouth is under the head, and used like a suction cup to attach and feed on algae; females tend to be smaller, and fish larger than 18 inches probably males; lifeless and hollowed-out 'armored' bodies sometimes seen on canal and lake banks","Sailfin catfish live in nearly any type of slow moving streams, canals, ponds, and lakes; and are normally most abundant along the shore and in shallower waters. They are known to create spawning burrows along shorelines, sometimes undermining canal banks and lake shorelines. Little is known about the vermiculated sailfin's specific habitat preferences; poor success of suckermouth catfish to date indicates it is less well adapted to Florida waters than are the sailfins.","Spawning Habitats: Male and females start maturing when 13 and 11 inches long; female lays about 2,000 eggs in shoreline burrows, holes, or crevices generally between April and September; nests guarded until eggs hatch; adhesive eggs clump together in masses; egg masses are sometimes collected from the wild, aerated, hatched, and grown on tropical fish farms for sale in the pet industry.",,https://myfwc.com/media/13929/sailfincatfish.jpg
162,Shoal Bass,Micropterus cataractae,Native,"Shoal bass are similar in body shape to largemouth bass, but unlike the largemouth, the shoal bass has scales on the base portion of the second dorsal fin; their first and second dorsal fins are clearly connected, and its upper jaw does not extend past the eye. Shoal bass also lack the dark lateral (down the side) band that largemouth have. Shoal bass have vertical stripes above the midline of the body which resemble tiger stripes.","Although historically found in the Apalachicola River, habitat degradation has all but eliminated shoal bass from the river proper.  Very limited numbers of shoal bass can be found just downstream from Jim Woodruff Dam, where a few ""shoal"" type habitats still remain.  The best destination to catch shoal bass in Florida is the Chipola River.","Shoal bass primarily eat crustaceans (crayfish) but will also eat a variety of fish and insects. Shoal bass are primarily found among river shoals (shallow, fast moving riffles and runs containing limestone) but larger shoal bass can often be found in the deeper pools containing limestone formations above and below the shoals.",State Record:  5.20 lbs.,https://myfwc.com/media/16198/shoalbass.jpg

164,Spotted Bass,Micropterus punctulatus,Native,"Spotted bass are similar to largemouth bass, but unlike the largemouth, the spotted bass has scales on the base portion of the second dorsal fin; their first and second dorsal fins are clearly connected, and its upper jaw does not extend past the eye. A rectangular tooth patch on the tongue also helps distinguish the spotted bass from other black bass species such as the largemouth bass and shoal bass.","They prefer small to medium streams and rivers with clear, slow-moving water, and gravel or rock bottoms. Seldom found in natural lakes, and they do not enter brackish water.",Grow slower than largemouth bass and do not attain as large a size as other black bass.,State Record:  3.75 lbs.,https://myfwc.com/media/16200/spottedbass.jpg
165,Spotted Sunfish,Lepomis punctatus,Native,"The spotted sunfish (“stumpknocker”) is relatively nondescript. As the name suggests, however, its most characteristic feature is the distinct, even rows of small spots along the body. These dots are usually dark, but may be red. In overall coloration, the fish ranges from olive to brown. In general form, this small sunfish also appears somewhat “chunkier” or plumper than other sunfishes. The state record is 0.83 pounds, but most catches of this diminutive sportfish will average closer to a quarter pound. The Big Catch minimum qualifying sizes are 0.5 pounds or 7 inches for adults, and 0.4 lbs or 5 inches for youth (BigCatchFlorida.com).","Spotted sunfish are found throughout Florida’s lakes and rivers, but are deliberately targeted most by stream anglers in the northern part of our state. Some specific sites to try include the Choctawhatchee River, Holmes Creek and Lake Panasoffkee.","Don't let this fish's small size fool you—they are very aggressive in defending their bed during the spawning season. The spotted sunfish will take most small lures and baits and puts up a good fight. Its small size makes it ideal for ultralight tackle. A flyrod also works well, and this fish is particularly susceptible to tiny nymphs. Excellent baits include grass shrimp, live worms, and crickets—standard bream fare. The spotted sunfish is often caught incidentally by anglers targeting its larger relatives, the bluegill and redear sunfish. This fish is sometimes deliberately sought after by north Florida stream anglers. While quite edible, most anglers consider only larger representatives of this species to be big enough for the frying pan.",,https://myfwc.com/media/26195/spotted-sunfish.jpg
166,Spotted Tilapia, ,Nonnative,"Light yellow to bronze with 6-9 bars or spots along side; stouter but similar body and mouth shape to native sunfishes; small ones tend to have bars that turn into spots in larger fish (see photo); some have reddish markings on the chin or throat area, especially when spawning; sometimes erroneously referred to as an 'oscar.'","Prefers slow-flowing canals, ponds, and lakes; common throughout south Florida; may be increasing in some areas, but not as abundant in Miami-Dade County as in 1980s.","Spawning Habitats: Unlike other tilapia in Florida, this tilapia is a substrate spawner that lays about 2,000 sticky eggs on hard, flat surfaces; both parents guard young aggressively until about one inch long; sexually mature at 7 inches; some observed spawning year around, but most spawning seems to occur in cooler months between November and March.","Special Note: Possession and transport of live tilapia in Florida is illegal without a special permit (except blue tilapia); can only be possessed if dead, so anglers wanting to eat this fish should immediately place them on ice.",https://myfwc.com/media/13930/spottedtilipia.jpg
167,Striped Bass,Morone saxatilis,Native,Striped bass are quick powerful fish with silvery sides and white belly. They have seven or eight black stripes along the sides. Stripes are absent on young fish of less than six inches.,"In Florida, striped bass are found primarily in the St. Johns River and its tributaries, and a few panhandle rivers. Striped bass need long stretches of flowing water to reproduce successfully. These conditions are rare in Florida.","Stripers do not tolerate water temperatures over 75˚F for long. During Florida summers, striped bass become less active and must find cool water to survive.

Breeding males may have two dark bands running along the sides, separated by a pinkish or reddish band along the midline of the sides.","Suckers can be found throughout the state, but most species are concentrated in northwest Florida. Spotted suckers are found in northern Florida streams, from the Perdido River to the Suwannee River.","These fish use their small sucker mouth to “vacuum” small insects or other invertebrates from lake or stream bottoms. Suckers play an important role in the ecology of many Florida waters, often providing food for game fish.",State Record:  FWC does not track state records for suckers.,https://myfwc.com/media/16240/spottedsucker.jpg
169,Sunshine Bass,Hybrid of white bass x striped bass,Native,"Sunshine bass were first produced in Florida by state hatcheries, and all sunshines are still produced and stocked. This is because they are a hybrid of a female white bass and male striped bass that does not occur naturally. Sunshines often have broken stripes on the front half and straight lines on the rear half of the body.",Sunshines occur where they are stocked by the FWC--typically in community lakes or waters with an abundance of shad.,Sunshines are voracious feeders and consume any kind of small fish including threadfin and gizzard shad.
