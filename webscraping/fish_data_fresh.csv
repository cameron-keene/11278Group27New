0,American Eel,Anguilla rostrata,Native,"The American Eel is also known as the pencil eel, yellow eel, black eel, silver eel, Boston eel, Atlantic eel or common eel. The body is extremely elongated (snakelike), with a very long dorsal fin that is confluent with the anal fin.  Pelvic fins are absent and tiny scales are embedded in the skin giving eels a smooth feel.  The adult color is a yellow-brown with pale underbelly. It is a distinct species with no known subspecies.  Similar species exist around Japan, Australia and Europe. This is a gourmet fish in the Asian markets and is often used in Sushi.  It tends to be bony by American standards but is good smoked.",American eels are found in waters with coastal access along the Atlantic seaboard of the US. Eels are primarily riverine but access ponds and lakes.  They orient to structure and flow.,"Spawning is still not well understood but fascinating.  The adults migrate to the ocean during autumn.  During the long trek the fish metamorphose into a ""silver eel"" stage and stop eating.  The fish head to a location near the Sargasso Sea where they spawn en masse and apparently die.  The eggs hatch into leaf-shaped floating leptocephalus larvae that drift with the currents.  When they come within range of a freshwater river, the leptocephalus metamorphoses again into a tiny semi-transparent ""glass eel"".  The glass eel then changes again into a pigmented pencil eel and continues its migration upstream to find a habitat to mature and await it's time to go spawn.  This process of spawning in the ocean and maturing inland is termed catadromy (the fish are catadromous). American eels are opportunistic feeders, which means they eat whatever food is available to them. They are considered carnivorous and eat a variety of food, including fish, frogs, insects and dead organisms. American eels are known to live as long as 43 years, but generally migrate to spawn and die long before then.",State Record:  Approximately 60-inch long male weighing about 16 pounds.

It is tolerant of saltwater and found in some near shore marine habitats, such as Tampa Bay.","Spawning Habits: Spawning occurs when the water temperature exceeds 68oF. Males dig large circular nests with their mouths in shallow water over a sandy bottom. The male swims out to a passing female and leads her to the nest where courtship occurs; female lays eggs and immediately takes into mouth after male fertilizes, after which she swims off, possibly to mate with another male. The males continue to guard nests and may spawn again with another female. Eggs hatch in female's mouth, and fry occasionally released to feed, but whenever threatened they return to the female's mouth until they are about three weeks old. This type of parental care is called mouth-brooding.",State record: 9.57 pounds.

Little is known about the vermiculated sailfin's specific habitat preferences; poor success of suckermouth catfish to date indicates it is less well adapted to Florida waters than are the sailfins.","Spawning Habitats: Male and females start maturing when 13 and 11 inches long; female lays about 2,000 eggs in shoreline burrows, holes, or crevices generally between April and September; nests guarded until eggs hatch; adhesive eggs clump together in masses; egg masses are sometimes collected from the wild, aerated, hatched, and grown on tropical fish farms for sale in the pet industry.",
37,Shoal Bass,Micropterus cataractae,Native,"Shoal bass are similar in body shape to largemouth bass, but unlike the largemouth, the shoal bass has scales on the base portion of the second dorsal fin; their first and second dorsal fins are clearly connected, and its upper jaw does not extend past the eye. Shoal bass also lack the dark lateral (down the side) band that largemouth have. Shoal bass have vertical stripes above the midline of the body which resemble tiger stripes.","Although historically found in the Apalachicola River, habitat degradation has all but eliminated shoal bass from the river proper.  Very limited numbers of shoal bass can be found just downstream from Jim Woodruff Dam, where a few ""shoal"" type habitats still remain.  The best destination to catch shoal bass in Florida is the Chipola River.","Shoal bass primarily eat crustaceans (crayfish) but will also eat a variety of fish and insects. Shoal bass are primarily found among river shoals (shallow, fast moving riffles and runs containing limestone) but larger shoal bass can often be found in the deeper pools containing limestone formations above and below the shoals.",State Record:  5.20 lbs.
38,Shortnose sturgeon,Acipenser brevirostrum,Native,"The shortnose sturgeon is one of seven species of sturgeons found in North America.  Sturgeons are prehistoric species that date back to the time of dinosaurs.  They are popular in the food industry as a source of caviar.  Their physical features separate them from other kinds of fish, such as a spiral valve stomach and a cartilaginous skeleton (like sharks and rays) but, they have scutes (hard, protective, large individual body plates) instead of denticles like sharks have or scales like other fish have.  Shortnose sturgeon have barbels located on the underside of the snout, no teeth, rubbery lips, and a suctorial mouth for vacuuming food off the bottom.  The sturgeon's coloring typically is dark brown along the upper (dorsal) side, shading to a creamy white-colored belly (Wakeford 2001).  The shortnose sturgeon is one of the smallest sturgeons with a body length of three to four feet (.9-1.2 meters) and a weight of up to eight pounds (3.6 kilograms).","Shortnose sturgeon are classified as anadromous, living in the estuarine reaches of most Atlantic seaboard rivers and ascending to flowing freshwater to spawn.  They tend to congregate in the main river channels and only use smaller tributaries to a lesser extent.  While shortnose sturgeons only occasionally frequent marine habitats, they can tolerate full seawater, and do migrate between rivers.  The shortnose sturgeon can be found from New Brunswick Canada, to the St. Johns River in Florida (National Marine Fisheries Service 1998).","Sturgeons are benthic feeders consuming organisms on, in, or near the bottom of a water body.  Preferred prey includes worms, crustaceans, insect larvae, and molluscs (National Marine Fisheries Service 1998).", 
39,Southern Tesselated Darter,Etheostoma olmstedi maculaticeps,Native,The Southern tessellated darter is a small brown fish that can reach lengths of four inches (10.2 centimeters).  Both sexes have 9-11 dark “X” or “Y” shaped marks on their side.  Breeding males have a larger second dorsal fin than females (Florida Natural Areas Inventory 2001).,"The Southern tessellated darter can be found in coastal streams from the Cape Fear River drainage in North Carolina to the St. Johns River in Florida (Cole 1967, Rohde et al. 2009, Florida Natural Areas Inventory 2001).  In Florida, the population is found in portions of the North Central part of the state.","The diet of Southern tessellated darters primarily consists of small fish, crustaceans, and insects (Gilbert 1992).", 
40,Spotted Bass,Micropterus punctulatus,Native,"Spotted bass are similar to largemouth bass, but unlike the largemouth, the spotted bass has scales on the base portion of the second dorsal fin; their first and second dorsal fins are clearly connected, and its upper jaw does not extend past the eye. A rectangular tooth patch on the tongue also helps distinguish the spotted bass from other black bass species such as the largemouth bass and shoal bass.","They prefer small to medium streams and rivers with clear, slow-moving water, and gravel or rock bottoms. Seldom found in natural lakes, and they do not enter brackish water.",Grow slower than largemouth bass and do not attain as large a size as other black bass.,State Record:  3.75 lbs.
41,Spotted Sunfish,Lepomis punctatus,Native,"The spotted sunfish (“stumpknocker”) is relatively nondescript. As the name suggests, however, its most characteristic feature is the distinct, even rows of small spots along the body. These dots are usually dark, but may be red. In overall coloration, the fish ranges from olive to brown. In general form, this small sunfish also appears somewhat “chunkier” or plumper than other sunfishes. The state record is 0.83 pounds, but most catches of this diminutive sportfish will average closer to a quarter pound. The Big Catch minimum qualifying sizes are 0.5 pounds or 7 inches for adults, and 0.4 lbs or 5 inches for youth (BigCatchFlorida.com).","Spotted sunfish are found throughout Florida’s lakes and rivers, but are deliberately targeted most by stream anglers in the northern part of our state. Some specific sites to try include the Choctawhatchee River, Holmes Creek and Lake Panasoffkee.","Don't let this fish's small size fool you—they are very aggressive in defending their bed during the spawning season. The spotted sunfish will take most small lures and baits and puts up a good fight. Its small size makes it ideal for ultralight tackle. A flyrod also works well, and this fish is particularly susceptible to tiny nymphs. Excellent baits include grass shrimp, live worms, and crickets—standard bream fare. The spotted sunfish is often caught incidentally by anglers targeting its larger relatives, the bluegill and redear sunfish. This fish is sometimes deliberately sought after by north Florida stream anglers. While quite edible, most anglers consider only larger representatives of this species to be big enough for the frying pan.",
42,Spotted Tilapia, ,Nonnative,"Light yellow to bronze with 6-9 bars or spots along side; stouter but similar body and mouth shape to native sunfishes; small ones tend to have bars that turn into spots in larger fish (see photo); some have reddish markings on the chin or throat area, especially when spawning; sometimes erroneously referred to as an 'oscar.'","Prefers slow-flowing canals, ponds, and lakes; common throughout south Florida; may be increasing in some areas, but not as abundant in Miami-Dade County as in 1980s.","Spawning Habitats: Unlike other tilapia in Florida, this tilapia is a substrate spawner that lays about 2,000 sticky eggs on hard, flat surfaces; both parents guard young aggressively until about one inch long; sexually mature at 7 inches; some observed spawning year around, but most spawning seems to occur in cooler months between November and March.","Special Note: Possession and transport of live tilapia in Florida is illegal without a special permit (except blue tilapia); can only be possessed if dead, so anglers wanting to eat this fish should immediately place them on ice."
43,Striped Bass,Morone saxatilis,Native,Striped bass are quick powerful fish with silvery sides and white belly. They have seven or eight black stripes along the sides. Stripes are absent on young fish of less than six inches.,"In Florida, striped bass are found primarily in the St. Johns River and its tributaries, and a few panhandle rivers. Striped bass need long stretches of flowing water to reproduce successfully. These conditions are rare in Florida.","Stripers do not tolerate water temperatures over 75˚F for long. During Florida summers, striped bass become less active and must find cool water to survive. Striped bass populations depend on annual stockings from FWC and federal hatcheries.",State Record:  42.25 lbs.
44,Sucker, ,Native,"Suckers as a group have large thick lips, soft-rayed fins with no spines, and lack scales on the head. The spotted sucker illustrated here has a long body, protrusible (extendable) lips, and 8-12 rows of distinct dark spots. Breeding males may have two dark bands running along the sides, separated by a pinkish or reddish band along the midline of the sides.","Suckers can be found throughout the state, but most species are concentrated in northwest Florida. Spotted suckers are found in northern Florida streams, from the Perdido River to the Suwannee River.","These fish use their small sucker mouth to “vacuum” small insects or other invertebrates from lake or stream bottoms. Suckers play an important role in the ecology of many Florida waters, often providing food for game fish.",State Record:  FWC does not track state records for suckers.
45,Sunshine Bass,Hybrid of white bass x striped bass,Native,"Sunshine bass were first produced in Florida by state hatcheries, and all sunshines are still produced and stocked. This is because they are a hybrid of a female white bass and male striped bass that does not occur naturally. Sunshines often have broken stripes on the front half and straight lines on the rear half of the body.",Sunshines occur where they are stocked by the FWC--typically in community lakes or waters with an abundance of shad.,Sunshines are voracious feeders and consume any kind of small fish including threadfin and gizzard shad. Young fish also feed on mayflies and crustaceans. Sunshines travel and feed in schools with peak activity in early morning or evening.,State Record:  16.31 lbs.
46,Suwannee Bass,Micropterus notius,Native,"A heavy-bodied black bass that seldom exceeds 12 inches long. Mature Suwannee bass have bright turquoise coloring on the cheeks, breast, and belly. The upper jaw does not extend beyond the eye, and there is only a shallow notch between the dorsal fins. A distinct dark blotch where the lateral line meets the caudal fin and scales on bases of dorsal, anal and caudal fins further identify Suwannee bass.","Suwannee bass can be caught in the Ichetucknee, Santa Fe, St. Marks, Suwannee, Wacissa, and Wakulla rivers of Florida, as well as the Alapaha, Ochlockonee, and Withlacoochee rivers of Florida and Georgia.  A riverine fish, Suwannee bass are often found in moderate to swift currents near limestone or woody structure.",Spawning occurs from February to June. Crayfish are a major food item for Suwannees.,State Record:  3.89 lbs.
47,Swamp Eel, ,Nonnative,"Body snake-like tapering to a point; small eyes, tiny scales, and finless; typically dark reddish-brown with light tan to orange abdomen, but some are light orange, pink or white, with dark calico-like markings; heavy mucous coating facilitates burrowing nature; secretive and most active at night, but generally considered a 'sluggish' fish; present in Hawaii for 100 years with negligible effects on native species.","Prefers shallow, sluggish, standing, or even stagnant waters and dense vegetation; often burrows or submerges in mud bottoms; can live in waters without oxygen because it breathes air. In native range found in ponds, canals, ditches, rice-fields, and swamps and is reported to survive in moist mud during dry season.","Spawning Habitats: Spawns in summer; some reports indicate it is a bubble nest builder species, others say uses burrows for egg incubation; ripe female typically contains about 440 ready to spawn eggs; hermaphroditic-- all mature as females, and some of these females later become males; most populations have highly skewed sex ratio dominated by females.",
48,Walking Catfish, ,Nonnative,"Elongated, gray, and scaleless catfish-type body with a large mouth, sharp pectoral spines, and four pairs of barbels; light to dark gray in color, but albinos occur; noted for ability to breath air and make short overland movements by pulling themselves along with their pectoral fins much like an infantry-man scooting under barbed wire; early accounts that this fish would eliminate native fishes were erroneous, and it has not had major detrimental effects; species occasionally abundant and still considered undesirable.","Prefers shallow and highly vegetated water bodies; sometimes abundant in small deeper ponds without normal complement of native fishes. They sometimes dominate small Everglades pools during the dry season, but not necessarily to the exclusion of native fishes. They are much less abundant in large lakes and canals, and then usually only found in shallow vegetated areas; can live and even thrive in water with little to no oxygen since can breathe air; well-adapted to transient water bodies with muddy bottoms that partially dry up seasonally; occasionally found in road storm drainage systems from which they emerge during flooding events; habitat preferences tend to segregate this fish thereby reducing its overall effect on native species.","Spawning Habitats: Little known, but reports from India indicate spawn early in rainy season when build nests in submerged vegetation; adhesive eggs laid on vegetation, and guarded by male.","Special Note: Possession and transportation of live walking catfish is illegal without special state and federal permits; can only be possessed dead, so anglers who want to try eating them should immediately put them on ice."
49,Warmouth,Lepomis gulosus,Native,"It has a stout, deep body similar to other panfish. A red eye and large mouth are conspicuous field marks. Three or four dark stripes radiating back from the eye across the cheek and gill cover like war paint confirm the identity.","Warmouths inhabit swamps, marshes, shallow lakes, slow-moving streams and canals with soft, muddy bottoms. They stay around aquatic vegetation, stumps and snags and under the banks of streams and ponds. They have more tolerance for muddy water than most species.","Warmouths are solitary nesters that prefer to nest adjacent to a submerged object. Nests are found over a wide range of water depths. They often spawn more than once a year usually between April and August. Crayfish, shrimp, insects and small fishes make up the bulk of their diet. Most feeding is done in the morning, as it appears to sleep at night.",State Record:  2.44 lbs.
50,White Bass,Morone chrysops,Native,"White bass look like short stripers. They are silvery-white with five to eight dusky black stripes on the sides. Stripes below the lateral line are faint and may be uneven. Whites are stockier than stripers, with a smaller head, and dorsal fins are set closer together.",White bass are found mostly in the Apalachicola and Ochlockonee river systems.,"Male white bass move upstream in big schools to a dam or other barrier in early spring, Females follow, and spawning occurs in moving water over shoals or hard bottoms. Females may lay as many as half a million adhesive eggs that stick to rocks and gravel. White bass eat minnows and open-water baitfish like gizzard or threadfin shad.",State Record:  4.69 lbs.
51,White Catfish,Ameirus catus,Native,"Sides are blue-gray to blue-black and may be mottled. The tail is moderately forked, and the anal fin is shorter and rounder than that of channel or blue catfish.",Found statewide in rivers and streams and in slightly brackish coastal waters.,"Although fish are their major food, whites also eat larval aquatic insects, small crustaceans, fish eggs and aquatic plants. They may feed at night, but are not as nocturnal as other catfish.",State Record:  18.88 lbs.
52,Yellow Bullhead,Ameirus natalis,Native,"Similar to brown bullhead but with light colored chin barbels and, usually, lighter overall coloration.","The habitat is variable and includes vegetated areas of clear, shallow lakes, reservoirs, ponds, and slow-flowing streams. They are more tolerant of polluted environments than most other members of the catfish family.","Though scavengers, yellow bullheads prefer to feed on minnows, snails, shrimp and crayfish.",State Record:  5.05 pounds.
