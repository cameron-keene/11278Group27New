Amberjack are not shy or picky, so you can make all the noise you want, and almost any lively baitfish will be readily accepted. Commonly used baitfish species include blue runners, pinfish, pigfish, grunts, cigar minnows and sand perch. Because amberjacks like to swim around above the reef, it’s a good idea to use just enough lead to keep the bait in the middle of the water column. When amberjack get excited, they will also come to the surface and explode on top-water plugs, jigs, spoons and diving lures. Amberjack are extremely strong fighters with great endurance. To avoid lost or broken tackle, it’s important to have the drag pre-set to match the strength of the angler and the equipment."

51,Gulf Sturgeon,Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi,Native,"The Gulf sturgeon, also known as the Gulf of Mexico sturgeon, is one of seven species of sturgeon found in North America.  Sturgeons are prehistoric species that date back to the time of dinosaurs.  Sturgeons are popular in the food industry as a source of caviar.  They have physical features that separate them from other kinds of fish, such as a spiral valve stomach and cartilaginous skeleton (like sharks and rays); however, they have scutes (hard, protective, large individual body plates) instead of shark’s denticles or bony-fish’s scales.  Gulf sturgeon have barbels located on the underside of the snout, no teeth, rubbery lips, and a suctorial mouth for vacuuming food off the bottom.  The sturgeon's coloring typically is dark brown along the upper (dorsal) side shading to a creamy white-colored belly (Wakeford 2001).  Gulf sturgeon are large fish that can exceed a length of eight feet (2.4 meters), a weight of over 300 pounds (137 kilograms), and possess strength to leap nine feet (2.7 meters) into the air.","Sturgeon are anadromous, a term used to describe fish that spend a part of their lives in saltwater, yet travel upstream in freshwater rivers to spawn. Such fish return year after year to the same stream where they were hatched. For Gulf sturgeon, which are found from Florida to Louisiana, this means a move from salt to fresh water between February and April and a move downriver between September and November. They spend the winter in the Gulf of Mexico in sandy-bottom habitats six to 100 feet deep, where their diet consists of marine worms, grass shrimp, crabs and a variety of other bottom-dwelling organisms. They eat very little while in freshwater rivers.","Little is known about the early life stages of the Gulf sturgeon throughout its range.   After the late 1800s, Gulf sturgeon populations declined dramatically, a result of the high demand for their delicious meat and valuable roe, and dam construction, dredging activity and other man-made habitat alterations. The decline prompted state and federal officials to place the sturgeon on the protected species lists in the 1980s and 1990s and to enact a harvesting and possession ban. Today, the free-flowing, spring-fed Suwannee River supports the largest and most robust population of Gulf sturgeon in the state and the wider Gulf of Mexico region. Adults spawn on scoured limestone substrates in the upper reaches of this 200-mile long river. As they swim along, sturgeon occasionally leap out of the water. Every spring and summer, lucky boaters and campers along the Suwannee River witness this spectacle. Power boaters can reduce the risk of injury to themselves and the fish by boating slower during the appropriate time of year. This also increases the chance of seeing the sturgeon and other wildlife along the way.",

95,Smalltooth sawfish,Pristis pectinata,Native,"The smalltooth sawfish is a cartilaginous fish that belongs to the Subclass Elasmobranchii, which also includes all sharks and rays.  This dorsally tannish-brown fish can reach a total length of up to 18 feet (5.5 meters) including the saw (Bigelow and Schroeder 1953).  The species’ common and scientific names are derived from its long, flattened, toothed rostrum (nose or beak structure) that extends outward from its flattened head.  The rostrum resembles a saw because it has 24–32 unpaired saw teeth on each side.  Rostral teeth that are lost will not grow back; however, chipped teeth will continue to grow as long as the base is intact (Slaughter and Springer 1968).  The mouth teeth are small and flat like other rays.  The smalltooth sawfish is considered a type of ray, in part because the gill slits are located on the bottom of the body and the pectoral fins are attached to the head.","Juvenile smalltooth sawfish habitats differ from adult habitats.  Juveniles inhabit coastal areas such as estuaries, river mouths, and bays year-round.  They have been recorded from a variety of habitat types including un-vegetated mud and sand bottoms, especially along red mangrove shorelines.  Also, juveniles use creeks and canals that connect to the main stem of rivers as habitat. (Poulakis et al. 2010, 2011).  Potential habitat includes waters under docks, bridges, and piers.  Juveniles typically inhabit salinities between 18 and 30 parts per thousand (PPT) (the ocean is 35), sometimes miles up rivers (Poulakis et al. 2010, 2011; Simpfendorfer et al. 2011).  Adult smalltooth sawfish are typically found in open water habitats, but have been encountered near coral reefs and occur inshore during the spring when females give birth and mating is thought to occur.  Of seven species of sawfish found worldwide, the only species found in Florida waters is the smalltooth sawfish.  Although the historical range of this species extended from the U.S. down to Brazil, all life stages of smalltooth sawfish are found primarily from Charlotte Harbor, Florida to the Florida Keys (Seitz and Poulakis 2002; Poulakis and Seitz 2004, Mote Marine Laboratory Database).","Little is known about what the smalltooth sawfish feeds on.  Their diet is thought to consist of crabs, shrimp, small fish, and other bottom-dwelling organisms (Bigelow and Schroeder 1953).  The saw is used to slash at prey in the water column and to dislodge prey from bottom-dwelling habitats.", 
96,Smooth Dogfish,Mustelus canis,Native, ,"Primarily a demersal shark, commonly found in shallow bays, continental shelves, and near offshore banks.  Occasionally found in freshwater; although, it’s unlikely they can survive for extended periods of time in low salinities. Known to migrate seasonally into colder waters during spring and move into warmer waters in the fall.", ,"Since there are multiple species that are similar and difficult to distinguish apart in the fishery, Florida has lumped these into a Mustelus complex. Constitutes only a small portion of the Florida coastal commercial shark fishery, as the bulk of this commercial fishery is landed along the mid-Atlantic coast where it’s targeted for their marketable flesh and hide.
